Scenario 1: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart is empty and not purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart is empty and not purchased. It is expected to return the default hashCode value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty Cart and make sure it is not purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns the default value for an empty Cart that is not purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 2: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart is empty but purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart is empty but purchased. It is expected to return a different hashCode value than the default one.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty Cart and set it as purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a different value for an empty Cart that is purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is not purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testNonEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is not purchased. It is expected to return a different hashCode value than the default one and the one for an empty Cart.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart, add some books to it and make sure it is not purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a different value for a Cart that has books and is not purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test to check the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is purchased
  Details:
    TestName: testNonEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode
    Description: This test checks the hashCode value when the Cart has books and is purchased. It is expected to return a unique hashCode value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart, add some books to it and set it as purchased.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned hashCode is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a unique value for a Cart that has books and is purchased. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the hashCode method in such scenarios.

The error message indicates that the expected value of the hashCode, which was set to 1237, does not match the actual hashCode that was returned when the test was run, which was 2229. 

This discrepancy is due to the way the hashCode is calculated in the business logic method. The hashCode for a Cart object is calculated based on the hashCode of the 'books' list and the value of the 'purchased' boolean. The 'books' list is initialized as an empty ArrayList in the Cart constructor, and the 'purchased' boolean is set to false in the test. 

The hashCode for an empty ArrayList is 1, and the hashCode for the 'purchased' boolean when it's false is 1237. Thus, according to the logic in the hashCode method, the expected hashCode should be (31 * 1 + 1237), which equals 1268, not 1237 as expected in the test.

The issue here is that the test does not account for the hashCode of the 'books' ArrayList when calculating the expected hashCode. As such, the test is failing because it's not accurately predicting the value of the Cart object's hashCode. 

To fix this, the test should calculate the expected hashCode by taking into account both the 'books' list and the 'purchased' boolean, as is done in the hashCode method.

/*
The test `testEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode()` is failing because it's expecting the hashcode of the `Cart` object to be `1231`. However, the actual hashcode returned by the `hashCode()` method in `Cart` class is `2223`.

In the `hashCode()` method of the `Cart` class, the hashcode is calculated based on the `books` field and the `purchased` field. The `books` field is a list of `Book` objects and `purchased` is a boolean. The test is failing because the hashcode calculation takes into consideration the `books` list as well. 

The test sets up a new `Cart` object with an empty `books` list and sets `purchased` to `true`. The expected result is calculated assuming that the `books` list does not contribute to the hashcode, which is not the case. The `books` list, even though empty, contributes to the hashcode, causing a different result than expected.

Therefore, the expected value in the test case is incorrect because it doesn't account for the contribution of the `books` list to the hashcode. The `books` field is initialized as a new `ArrayList` in the `Cart` constructor, so it is not `null`. Its hashcode will not be `0`, but the hashcode of an empty list which is contributing to the actual hashcode to be different than the expected one. 

The test case should be corrected to include the hashcode of the `books` list in the expected result calculation.
@Test
@Category(Categories.valid.class)
public void testEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode() {
    Cart cart = new Cart();
    cart.setPurchased(true);
    int expectedHashCode = 1231;

/*
The testNonEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode() test case is failing because the expected and actual hashcode values do not match.

In the test case, you have created a cart and added a book to it. However, when you calculate the expectedHashCode, you are using an empty ArrayList's hashcode. This does not match the actual hashcode of the cart, which contains a book.

The hashCode() method in the Cart class is using the books ArrayList's hashcode as part of its calculation. If the ArrayList is not empty (as in this test case), its hashcode will not be zero, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual hashcode values.

The failure message ":91 expected:<1238> but was:<-642870892>" indicates that the expected hashcode (1238) does not match the actual hashcode (-642870892) returned by the cart.hashCode() method. 

To fix this test, you should calculate the expected hashcode based on the same criteria used in the hashCode() method in the Cart class. This includes taking into account the hashcode of the books ArrayList, which contains one book in this case, and the boolean 'purchased' field.
@Test
@Category(Categories.valid.class)
public void testNonEmptyCartNotPurchasedHashCode() {
    Cart cart = new Cart();
    cart.add(new Book("Author1", "Title1", "ISBN1"));
    cart.setPurchased(false);
    int expectedHashCode = new ArrayList<Book>().hashCode() + 1237;
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedHashCode, cart.hashCode());
}

/*
The test `testNonEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode()` is failing due to the incorrect expectation of the hashCode of the `Cart` object.

In the test, you have created a `Cart` object and added a `Book` object to it. You also set the `purchased` field of the `Cart` object to `true`. You then calculate the expected hashCode as the hashCode of an empty `ArrayList<Book>` plus `1231`.

However, the `hashCode()` method in the `Cart` class calculates the hash code based on the `books` and `purchased` fields. When you add a `Book` object to the `Cart`, the `books` field is no longer null, and its hashCode will be different from an empty `ArrayList<Book>`. 

The `books` field is a list of `Book` objects, and its hashCode is calculated based on the hashCodes of all `Book` objects in the list. Each `Book` object's hashCode is calculated based on its `author`, `isbn`, and `title` fields.

Therefore, the expected hashCode in your test should be the hashCode of a list containing the `Book` object you added to the `Cart`, plus `1231` or `1237` depending on the `purchased` field.

The error message ":101 expected:<1232> but was:<-642870898>" indicates that the expected hashCode (1232) does not match the actual hashCode (-642870898) of the `Cart` object. This discrepancy is due to the aforementioned reasons. 

If you want to fix this test, you should create an `ArrayList<Book>` with the `Book` object you added to the `Cart`, calculate its hashCode, and use this value plus `1231` as the expected hashCode.

@Category(Categories.valid.class)
public void testNonEmptyCartPurchasedHashCode() {
